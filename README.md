This is a tennis tournament website implemented using the Django framework. The project is launched under Windows by specifying the path venv/Srcipts/Activate, having activated the virtual environment,
you will already have Django installed and everything adjacent to it, starting the server, migration and other things can be found on the official documentation website   https://www.djangoproject.com/


main functionality
1) - authorization and registration and adding this to the database.
   - creation by the administrator of current games and maintaining their account (in the future it will be easier to make a parser to track this information).
   - creation of a bet by the user and saving information about this in the database
  

TO DO LIST !!!!!!
when expanding the application, you should leave sqlligt and switch to something more stable and large, you should also create a more convenient user panel for the administrator and create new entities in the database to store data about rates, sessions, etc.
